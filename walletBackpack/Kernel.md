# Kernel Technical Documentation

[View Source Code](https://github.com/underscore-finance/underscore-protocol/blob/master/contracts/core/walletBackpack/Kernel.vy)

## Overview

Kernel is the whitelist management module for user wallets in the Underscore Protocol. As a critical wallet backpack item, it provides secure, time-locked management of whitelisted addresses, enabling wallets to establish trusted relationships with external contracts and addresses while maintaining security through multi-tier permissions and delayed activation.

**Core Features**:
- **Time-locked Whitelist Operations**: All whitelist additions require time-delay for security
- **Multi-tier Permission System**: Owner, manager, and security roles with different capabilities
- **Two-step Confirmation Process**: Pending whitelist additions require explicit confirmation after time-lock
- **Flexible Permission Configuration**: Granular control over who can add, confirm, cancel, and remove
- **Emergency Override**: MissionControl integration for security interventions

The contract implements sophisticated permission validation ensuring only authorized parties can manage whitelist, time-locked operations preventing immediate additions, comprehensive event logging for audit trails, and integration with the broader wallet security framework.

    print("Address is whitelisted")
elif config.pendingWhitelist.initiatedBlock > 0:
    print(f"Pending until block {config.pendingWhitelist.confirmBlock}")
```

## Internal Permission Logic

### Permission Evaluation

The contract uses a two-tier permission system:

1. **Owner Privileges**:
   - Always has full control
   - Can perform any whitelist action
   - Bypasses all permission checks

2. **Manager Permissions**:
   - Must be an active manager
   - Requires both individual AND global permission
   - Each action type has specific permission flag

### Permission Matrix

| Action | Individual Permission | Global Permission | Description |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| ADD_PENDING | canAddPending | canAddPending | Add to pending whitelist |
| CONFIRM_WHITELIST | canConfirm | canConfirm | Confirm after time-lock |
| CANCEL_WHITELIST | canCancel | canCancel | Cancel pending entry |
| REMOVE_WHITELIST | canRemove | canRemove | Remove active entry |

### Security Override

MissionControl authorized addresses can:
- Cancel pending whitelist entries
- Remove active whitelist entries
- Bypass normal permission checks

## Security Considerations

### Time-lock Protection
- All whitelist additions require time-delay
- Prevents immediate malicious additions
- Time-lock duration set by wallet configuration
- Owner changes invalidate pending entries

### Permission Layers
1. Individual manager permissions
2. Global manager settings
3. MissionControl override
4. Owner ultimate control

### Validation Rules
- Cannot whitelist system addresses (wallet, owner, config)
- Cannot have duplicate pending entries
- Must verify owner consistency on confirmation
- Empty address validation

### Emergency Controls
- MissionControl can intervene for security
- Pending entries can be cancelled
- Active entries can be removed
- No funds at risk during pending period

## Common Integration Patterns

### Basic Whitelist Addition
```python
# 1. Add to pending whitelist
kernel.addPendingWhitelistAddr(
    wallet.address,
    defi_protocol.address,
    sender=owner
)

# 2. Wait for time-lock
boa.env.time_travel(blocks=timelock)

# 3. Confirm whitelist
kernel.confirmWhitelistAddr(
    wallet.address,
    defi_protocol.address,
    sender=owner
)
```

### Manager-Initiated Whitelist
```python
# 1. Manager adds pending (requires permission)
kernel.addPendingWhitelistAddr(
    wallet.address,
    new_integration.address,
    sender=manager
)

# 2. Owner confirms after review and time-lock
boa.env.time_travel(blocks=timelock)
kernel.confirmWhitelistAddr(
    wallet.address,
    new_integration.address,
    sender=owner
)
```

### Emergency Removal
```python
# Security team removes compromised contract
kernel.removeWhitelistAddr(
    wallet.address,
    compromised_contract.address,
    sender=security_admin  # MissionControl authorized
)
```

### Permission Check Before Action
```python
# Check if action is allowed
if kernel.canManageWhitelist(
    wallet.address,
    manager.address,
    WhitelistAction.ADD_PENDING
):
    kernel.addPendingWhitelistAddr(
        wallet.address,
        target.address,
        sender=manager
    )
```
