# Billing Technical Documentation

[ðŸ“„ View Source Code](../../../contracts/core/Billing.vy)

## Overview

Billing is the pull payment engine for the Underscore Protocol. As a Department contract, it enables authorized payees and cheque recipients to pull payments directly from [UserWallet](../userWallet/UserWallet.md) instances, implementing sophisticated asset discovery and yield withdrawal mechanisms to ensure payment fulfillment while maintaining security through permission validation and amount controls.

**Core Features**:
- **Pull Payment Support**: Enable payees and cheque recipients to pull authorized payments
- **Yield Asset Discovery**: Automatically find and withdraw from yield vaults for payment
- **Asset Management**: Intelligent deregistration of empty assets after payment
- **Permission Validation**: Strict verification of pull payment authorization
- **Buffer Management**: Apply buffers to ensure sufficient withdrawal amounts

The contract implements sophisticated payment logic including multi-source asset aggregation, automatic yield vault unwinding, partial payment support for payees, full payment requirements for cheques, and efficient asset cleanup after transfers.

- `underlyingAsset` - Underlying asset for vaults

## Internal Payment Logic

### Pull Payment Process

1. **Direct Balance Check**: First checks if wallet has sufficient direct balance
2. **Yield Discovery**: If insufficient, searches for yield vaults with matching underlying
3. **Withdrawal Calculation**: Calculates vault tokens needed with 1% buffer
4. **Asset Transfer**: Executes transfer through UserWallet contract
5. **Cleanup**: Deregisters assets with zero balance

### Yield Withdrawal Strategy

```
Target Amount = Requested Amount Ã— 101% (1% buffer)

For each yield asset:
  If underlying matches payment asset:
    Vault Tokens Needed = Target / Price Per Share
    Withdraw and aggregate
    Stop if target reached
```

### Permission Validation

**Cheque Recipients**:
- Global `ChequeSettings.canBePulled` must be true
- Individual `Cheque.canBePulled` must be true
- Additional validation occurs in Sentinel

**Payees**:
- Global `GlobalPayeeSettings.canPull` must be true
- Individual `PayeeSettings.canPull` must be true
- Additional validation occurs in Sentinel

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Strict validation of caller permissions
- User wallet verification through Ledger
- Configuration checks before payment

### Payment Security
- Cheques require exact payment amounts
- Payees allow partial payments for flexibility
- 1% buffer ensures sufficient withdrawals
- Automatic asset deregistration prevents dust

### State Management
- Nonreentrant guards on payment functions
- Proper ordering of operations
- Clean state after transfers

## Common Integration Patterns

### Cheque Pull Payment
```python
# Recipient checks and pulls cheque payment
if billing.canPullPaymentAsCheque(wallet, recipient.address):
    try:
        amount, usd_value = billing.pullPaymentAsCheque(
            wallet,
            payment_asset,
            cheque_amount,
            sender=recipient
        )
        print(f"Received ${usd_value} cheque payment")
    except:
        print("Insufficient funds for cheque")
```

### Payee Pull Payment
```python
# Payee pulls available funds
if billing.canPullPaymentAsPayee(wallet, payee.address):
    # Request full amount but accept partial
    amount, usd_value = billing.pullPaymentAsPayee(
        wallet,
        payment_asset,
        requested_amount,
        sender=payee
    )
    
    if amount < requested_amount:
        print(f"Partial payment: {amount} of {requested_amount}")
```

### Yield-Aware Payment
```python
# Check if payment will require yield withdrawal
wallet_balance = token.balanceOf(wallet)
if wallet_balance < payment_amount:
    # Billing will automatically find and withdraw from vaults
    amount, value = billing.pullPaymentAsPayee(
        wallet,
        token.address,
        payment_amount
    )
    # Vaults were unwound to fulfill payment
```

### Asset Configuration Check
```python
# Get asset details for payment planning
config = billing.getAssetUsdValueConfig(asset)

if config.isYieldAsset:
    print(f"Yield asset with underlying: {config.underlyingAsset}")
else:
    print(f"Normal asset with {config.decimals} decimals")
```
